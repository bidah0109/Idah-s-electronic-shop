*Question 2: HTML Elements*
1. *Which 5 elements did you find most challenging to implement and why?*
    - `<form>`, `<table>`, `<flexbox>` (CSS layout), `<video>`, and `<canvas>`.
    - Challenges: handling form validation, complex table styling, aligning flex items, embedding and controlling video playback, and scripting canvas graphics.

2. *How did you use semantic elements (like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to structure your content?*
    - I wrapped related content in `<section>` for logical divisions, used `<article>` for independent pieces (e.g., blog posts), placed `<header>` for introductory info and navigation, and added `<footer>` for copyright and links. This improves readability and SEO.

3. *Which element was most useful for organizing your layout and why?*
    - `<div>` with CSS Grid/Flexbox. It gave flexible, responsive control over positioning and alignment of layout blocks.

*Question 3: HTML Attributes*
1. *Which 3 attributes were essential for making your website functional?*
    - `href` (links), `src` (images/scripts), and `alt` (accessibility & SEO).

2. *How did you use the class and id attributes differently?*
    - `class` for applying styles to multiple elements (reusable CSS rules).
    - `id` for unique element identification (JavaScript targeting or specific styling).

3. *Which attribute helped improve user experience the most and why?*
    - `aria-*` attributes (e.g., `aria-label`). They enhance accessibility for screen readers, making the site usable for more users.

*Question 4: Development Process*
1. *How did you plan your website structure before coding?*
    - Sketched wireframes, created a site map, and defined user flows to organize pages and content hierarchy.

2. *What was your approach to testing and debugging your HTML?*
    - Used browser DevTools to inspect elements, validated HTML with W3C validator, and tested responsiveness on multiple devices.

3. *What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?*
    - Cross-browser styling issues. Solved by normalizing CSS and using vendor prefixes or modern CSS resets.

*Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation*
1. *What Git commands did you use during development?*
    - `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git branch`, and `git merge`.

2. *How many commits did you make and what was your commit message strategy?*
    - Made 12 commits. Used clear, concise messages like “Add header navigation” to describe each change’s purpose.

3. *Why is version control important for web development projects?*
    - It tracks changes, enables collaboration, allows rollbacks to previous states, and maintains project history for debugging.
      
Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
1. I ensured my HTML was valid and error‑free by running it through the W3C Markup Validation Service, fixing all reported warnings and errors, and performing manual code reviews to catch any overlooked issues.

2. For clean, readable code I followed these best practices:
    - Used consistent indentation and spacing.
    - Wrote meaningful comments to explain sections of the markup.
    - Kept elements logically organized with semantic naming.
    - Minimized inline styles and separated structure from presentation.
    - Applied modular design to reuse common HTML patterns.

3. If I had more time, I would improve the website by:
    - Adding more accessibility features (ARIA attributes, enhanced keyboard navigation).
    - Optimizing performance with lazy loading and minified assets.
    - Refining responsive design for all device sizes.
    - Conducting cross‑browser testing to ensure consistent behavior.
    - Implementing automated testing for HTML validation.

*Technical Requirements Checklist*:
- ✅ 25+ different HTML elements used (e.g., `<div>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<form>`, etc.).
- ✅ 15+ different HTML attributes used (e.g., `id`, `class`, `src`, `alt`, `href`, `data-*`, etc.).
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure implemented (use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- ✅ Website works in a standard web browser (tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- ✅ GitHub repository with all code (repository includes full project files and commit history).
